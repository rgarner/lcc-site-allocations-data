The identification of the site as suitable for an allocation is consistent with the long-standing planning principle for its development stretching back 23 years.Executive Board in September 2013 agreed an outline development brief for Red Hall with key development principles, as part of the relocation strategy for the horticultural nursery (also encompasses site 795).  This includes routing of ELOR around its northern edge and retention of at least two playing pitches within the site.  The central Red Hall buildings are in the ownership of the RFL, and any development will have to respect their listed building status.  The existing pitches have protection under Sport England policies and through the UDP Policy E4:11 requirement for their replacement in development of the site, but they are not allocated greenspace.
